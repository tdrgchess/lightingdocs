# lightingdocs
A repo of training documentation for training within organization.

Thanks for joining me in this lonely lil' repo! Above, you'll find a folder with all the relavent documentation to learn ETC Eos software AND Qlab for sound. Big thanks to the folks at ETC and Figure58 for providing cheat sheets and inspiration for the self-made training curriculum featured here. Updates to the folder will not sync to your downloaded folder, you'll have to redownload.

If you work with me, or have extensive lighting knowledge, this repo is covered under the GLPV3 and lives open-source in nature. Feel free to add pull requests and have fun with it according to the license terms.

To download the files, please click "code" and then "download zip". (Your git cli will work here, as always, but most of this audience won't be using it.)

Any questions? Shoot me a message at tdrgraham@gmail.com
