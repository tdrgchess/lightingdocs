# lightingdocs
A repo of training documentation for training within organization.

Thanks for joining me in this lonely lil' repo! Above, you'll find a folder with all the relavent documentation to learn ETC Eos software AND Qlab for sound. Big thanks to the folks at ETC and Figure58 for providing cheat sheets and inspiration for the self-made training curriculum featured here. 

To download the files, please click "code" and then "download zip". (Your git cli will work here, as always, but most of this audience won't be using it.)

Any questions? Shoot me a message at tdrgraham@gmail.com
