# lightingdocs
A repo of training documentation for training within organization.

Thanks for joining me in this lonely lil' repo! Above, you'll find a folder with all the relavent documentation to learn ETC Eos software AND Qlab for sound. Big thanks to the folks at ETC and Figure58 for providing cheat sheets and inspiration for the self-made training curriculum featured here. 

Any questions? Shoot me a message at tdrgraham@gmail.com
