# lightingdocs
A repo of training documentation for training within organization.

Thanks for joining me in this lonely lil' repo! Above, you'll find a folder with all the relavent documentation to learn ETC Eos software. Big thanks to the folks at ETC for providing cheat sheets and inspiration for the self-made training curriculum featured here. 

Any questions? Shoot me a message at tdrgraham@gmail.com
