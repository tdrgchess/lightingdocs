This document provides a framework for all updates to the repo in between versions. Check here if something isn't working re: compatibility.

V0.0.1-alpha
  This is a pre-release, unstable version of the repo which is comprised solely of supporting documents. The bare-minimum, if you will. Full compatibility with any computer able 
  to open .pdf and .docx files *beware to linux users - this repo is NOT designed for your usage. Reference software (ie. ETC EOS and Qlab4) are not available on any linus distros 
  (that is to say, unless you want to run an emulator - not recommended).
